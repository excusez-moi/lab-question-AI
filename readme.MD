# AI-Powered Lab Question Generation System

## 1. The Problem

In academic settings, particularly in lab-based courses, a recurring issue arises when all students receive the same question. This often leads to reduced learning efficiency, increased chances of plagiarism, and difficulty in conducting fair, unbiased evaluations. Traditional methods of creating varied questions are time-consuming and often result in inconsistent difficulty levels.

## 2. The Solution

This project is a robust, AI-powered system designed to automatically generate unique but equivalent lab questions for each student. The system leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to ensure that no two students receive the exact same question, while maintaining a consistent level of difficulty and fairness.

The application serves as an administrative dashboard for instructors to manage question templates, generate batches of questions, track student assignments, and monitor activity, ensuring a streamlined and equitable evaluation process.

## 3. Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Question Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4 to create unique and varied lab questions from a base template.
- **üìù Template-Based Approach**: Instructors can create question templates with variables that the AI uses to generate diverse problem sets.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Consistent Difficulty**: AI is used to evaluate and maintain a consistent difficulty level across all generated questions, ensuring fairness.
- **üë®‚Äçüè´ Instructor Dashboard**: A comprehensive interface for instructors to manage students, question templates, assignments, and question batches.
- **üîê Role-Based Access Control**: Secure authentication for instructors/admins using Replit's OpenID Connect.
- **üìä Tracking & Logging**: System for tracking assignments and logging all major activities for a complete audit trail.
